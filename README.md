FuelPlanner
===========

xFuel is an open source fuel planning app for Android and is now available at the Play Store. xFuel lets you quickly and easily generate load sheets for your flight. Be it in FSX, X-Plane or other simulators, all you need to do is pick an aircraft, your origin and destination, and with a tap of a button you'll get all the information you need. Compatible with any flight simulator, no plugins needed. More than 30 aircraft with accurate data are included, with support for FARDOM, INTL and JAR rules. Fuel Planning output can be in metric or imperial units. METAR information can be requested, but is currently only available for select airports. xFuel features a stunningly beautiful minimalistic Holo interface, and scales well to any device.
